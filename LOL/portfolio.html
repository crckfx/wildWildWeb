				<h2 class="subHeading">Understanding The Problem</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The UX industry is highly competitive, particularly for junior designers who are
					just emerging from study and looking to break into the field. Without real client work to show,
					I needed a way to stand out.
				</p>
				<div class="imageContainer">
					<div class="imageBox">
						<img src="" alt="Logo">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">To stand out in a competitive industry as a junior designer, I reimagined my
					portfolio as a live UX case study with interactive surveys for hiring managers teaching myself
					backend development along the way to build and host it independently.
				</p>
				<h2 class="subHeading">When Did I Realise That This Could Be My Solution</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I realised this early on while researching job opportunities—most roles
					preferred candidates with prior experience. That made it clear I needed to find a way to
					demonstrate value without relying on past clients. I started ideating around how to turn this
					limitation into a strength.
				</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">A portfolio is more than just a container for work it can be a live, usable
					product. By treating it as a project in itself, I could show what I’m capable of in real time.
					More importantly, I could bridge the gap between myself and my target market by making the
					hiring manager an active participant in the process.
				</p>
				<h2 class="subHeading">The Approach</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I began by asking a simple question: what should a UX portfolio actually do? To
					find out, I looked at a range of portfolios from successful designers. I paid attention to how
					they presented their work, how their content was structured, what felt effective, and what
					didn’t.
					Through this research, one thing became clear. If I’m applying for UX roles, my portfolio needs
					to reflect good UX. It should be easy to navigate, respectful of the viewer’s time, and engaging
					enough to stand out.
				</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">I realised that reaching my target audience, hiring managers, wasn’t going to be
					easy. Most portfolios don’t provide a way for the viewer to participate or leave feedback, which
					felt like a missed opportunity. I saw a gap.
				</p>
				<p class="bodyCopy">That’s when I started thinking differently. What if my portfolio wasn’t a static
					showcase, but a living product? Something that could grow and evolve through real user input.
					That thought became the foundation for what you’re experiencing now. It is a live case study
					shaped by real feedback.

				<h2 class="subHeading">Wireframes</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">To explore different ways of structuring the case study layout, I experimented
					with two wireframe directions:
				</p>
				<div class="imageContainer">
					<div class="imageBox">
						<img src="/resources/lachoutlaws/Images/Folio/wireframes.png" alt="Logo">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">Initially, I planned to use a full-page scrolling layout, where each section
					took up the full screen. It looked polished, but forced a linear flow and reduced the user’s
					ability to scan or jump freely between sections. It felt like a designer-driven decision, not a
					user-centred one—so I scrapped it.
				<p>

				<ul> I also intentionally cut:
					<li>Complex 3D animations</li>
					<li>Heavy page transitions</li>
					<li>Auto-scroll features</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="bodyCopy"> These were removed to keep the experience focused, performant, and
					distraction-free—especially for busy hiring managers.
				</p>


				<h2 class="subHeading">Extended Content Mode (In Development)</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The Extended Content toggle lets you control how much detail you see. ’Extended
					mode' reveals extra process insights with a smooth typing animation. Toggle it anytime, no
					reloads, no interruptions.
				</p>
				<div class="heroImage">
					<video class="heroVideo smartVideo" src="/resources/lachoutlaws/Images/extendedModeDemo.mp4" poster="" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"></video>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">In my research, I found that a common issue with portfolios is either being
					overloaded with information or too minimal, lacking enough detail. To solve this, Im introducing
					a toggle that lets users choose the level of content they want to see. This keeps the experience
					immersive while also being respectful of the user's time.

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2 class="subHeading">Survey</h2>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The embedded survey system creates a continuous feedback loop, turning every
					interaction into real-time insight on what works and what’s unclear, and using that input to
					guide future iterations of the portfolio.
				</p>
				<div class="heroImage">
					<video class="heroVideo smartVideo" src="/resources/lachoutlaws/Images/dataDemo.mp4" poster="" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"></video>
				</div>
				<p class="bodyCopy">The feedback is submitted through a form connected to my Firebase backend. Each
					response is stored along with the:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Timestamp</li>
					<li>Question answered</li>
					<li>User's selected response</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="bodyCopy">This setup allows me to review input in real time and understand how users are
					interacting with the portfolio. The data helps me identify what’s working and where improvements
					are needed, directly supporting the iterative goal of the project.

					This portfolio is a live case study that will continue to evolve. Every interaction and piece of

					the portfolio—but myself, as a designer who listens, learns, and creates with purpose.
				</p>
				<ul>This portfolio will continue to evolve based on:
					<li>Ongoing feedback from users and hiring managers</li>
					<li>New case studies and project work</li>
					<li>Improvements to my skills in UI/UX, frontend development, and 2D/3D design and animation
						As I grow as a designer and developer, the portfolio will reflect that growth—both in its
						content and how it’s presented.</li>
