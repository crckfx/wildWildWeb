## Sudoku Rules
A Sudoku puzzle starts with a 9x9 grid, whose 81 cells are each either `empty` or `some number (1-9)`

Given a 9x9 grid, we have 9 (horizontal) rows, 9 (vertical) columns, and 9 (3x3) boxes.

The goal is to fill all grid cells using numbers 1-9, satisfying the following conditions:
- each row contains numbers 1-9
- each column contains numbers 1-9
- each 3x3 box contains numbers 1-9
